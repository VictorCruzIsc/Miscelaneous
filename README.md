The main purpose of this repo is to save the different programs I've been working on.
It includes programs in:

- Python
- C
- C++
- Java

It has solutions for algorithms problems, architecture problems and some bash scripts for
automatization.

Many of the problems are solved in C or C++ but the approaches are the same.
